/**
 * FTC PIDF tuning guide.
 *
 * <p><b>What each gain does.</b> {@code kP} is how hard you push toward the target, like steering
 * harder when your car drifts off center. {@code kI} is the memory term that keeps adding a little
 * more push when the system still misses after a while. {@code kD} is the damper that reacts to
 * how fast the mechanism is already moving, like shocks on a car. {@code kF} is the predicted base
 * power for the reference so the PID terms only clean up the leftover error.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Universal tuning sequence.</b> Step 1: set {@code kP}, {@code kI}, and {@code kD} to zero
 * and start with only {@code kF}. For velocity, {@code kF} is usually near {@code 1 / maxVelocity}
 * after normalization or characterization. For position, {@code kF} is usually zero and you should
 * let {@code kP} drive the move. Step 2: raise {@code kP} until the mechanism reaches target
 * quickly and just starts to oscillate. Step 3: raise {@code kD} until that oscillation stops.
 * If you already know {@code kV} and {@code kA}, SMARTDAMP gives a strong starting point:
 * {@code kD = 2 * sqrt(kP / kA)} in the simplified normalized form, or
 * {@code kD = 2 * sqrt(kA * kP) - kV} in the plant-model form published by CTRL ALT FTC. Step 4:
 * only after {@code kF}, {@code kP}, and {@code kD} are close, add a tiny {@code kI} such as
 * {@code 0.01} if a small steady-state error remains. Never tune {@code kI} first because it can
 * hide instability instead of fixing it. Step 5: tune {@link PIDFTuningMode#REV_UP} and
 * {@link PIDFTuningMode#MAINTAIN} separately because fast approach and disturbance rejection want
 * different behavior.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Tuning servos.</b> Open-loop ({@code SERVO_OPEN_LOOP}) needs no PIDF tuning. Set
 * {@code minTicks} and {@code maxTicks} to match your mechanism's physical range, verify the servo
 * reaches both extremes cleanly, and tighten the range if it stalls at either limit. Closed-loop
 * standard servos ({@code SERVO_WITH_EXTERNAL_ENCODER}) follow the same sequence as motors, with
 * one important difference: positional servos already run internal PD control in firmware, so this
 * controller is effectively commanding {@code setPosition()} while the servo closes the inner loop.
 * That softens the visible effect of {@code kP}, so start lower than you would for a raw motor.
 * {@code kD} is often unnecessary because the servo firmware already damps motion, so try
 * {@code kD = 0} first. {@code kF} is often the most useful term when the servo fights gravity
 * because it offsets the servo's neutral position directly. For {@code CR_SERVO}, treat tuning
 * exactly like a DC motor because all motor tuning rules apply unchanged.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Servo-specific symptoms.</b> Servo jitters at setpoint: {@code kP} is too high because
 * the servo firmware and your outer loop are both damping. Servo does not hold under load:
 * increase {@code kF} for gravity compensation, or add a small {@code kI}. Analog feedback is
 * noisy: increase {@code derivativeAlpha} for more filtering. Servo reaches target but drifts:
 * check {@code voltageToTicksScale} calibration.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Symptoms and fixes.</b> Oscillates at setpoint: decrease {@code kP} or increase
 * {@code kD}. Never reaches setpoint: increase {@code kP} or check {@code kF}/{@code kStatic}.
 * Overshoots then recovers: {@code kD} is too low for the current {@code kP}. Slow on the final
 * ticks: {@code kP} is too low for small errors or the mechanism needs static feedforward. Drifts
 * under load: add gravity/cosine feedforward or a little {@code kI}. Oscillates on setpoint
 * change: derivative kick is the cause, and this controller already avoids it with derivative on
 * measurement. Integral causes overshoot: reduce {@code integralSumMax} or disable {@code kI} in
 * {@code REV_UP}.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>When to use each mode.</b> {@code REV_UP} is for fast arrival in autos where the next step
 * waits for completion. {@code MAINTAIN} is for holding a flywheel speed, elevator height, or arm
 * pose against real match disturbances.</p>
